<img alt="Team Lunch, Department Lunch, Office Lunch" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/blackhawks-red-light-district/assets_c/2009/11/4food-thumb-100x100-36307.jpg" /> Today our office floor was converted into canteen. Actually today in our office canteen some renovation work was going on. There was smell of paint in air and floor was occupied by dust mountains. We was unable to sit there then our HR team comes into the picture and they suggested to take the lunch from canteen and have it your own seat. Canteen manager has placed his all food items at one place and one by one all our coming to take the lunch and having in front of their PC.

It looks quite hilarious that someone is about take a bite of food and his manager's mail drop into his mailbox after that he was unable to do lunch properly and another girl was having lunch with one hand and another hand is occupied in designing.

At one place on the floor some people are standing and having lunch (like attending a wedding) while gossiping about one another. Although such kind of lunch is well known as team lunch, department lunch but i would call it as Floor Lunch.
